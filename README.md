Python Library for RNA Evolution


The objective of the rna-evol project is to propose a python tool for rna design by evolving a population of rna.

In order to run this,

    pip -r requirements.txt
    pip rnaevol
    import  rnaevol

rnaevol.inversfold(...)

It will run the algorithm, you'll need to modify the code to print stuff or something.
